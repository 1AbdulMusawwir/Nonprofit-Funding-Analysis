This project provides an in-depth analysis of funding trends and distribution among nonprofit organizations across the United States. The dataset includes information from over 200 organizations, covering a total funding flow of more than $130 million. Key focus areas include mission type, geographic distribution, and funding efficiency.

Tools Used:
Excel: Data from 200+ nonprofits was analyzed using Excel to uncover trends in funding patterns. I applied advanced Excel functions, including pivot tables, filtering, and data visualization tools like charts and graphs, to break down funding distribution by mission and geography.

PowerPoint: I created a presentation using PowerPoint to deliver the findings in a clear, visually compelling format. Visuals such as funding flow charts, geographic heat maps, and comparison tables were used to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders, including both nonprofits and funders.

AI Integration: AI-powered tools were employed to enhance the analysis by identifying patterns and predicting potential outcomes, such as which mission types or regions are likely to attract more funding. AI also helped in assessing the efficiency of funding utilization across different organizations.

This analysis offers valuable insights for nonprofits seeking to improve their fundraising strategies and for funders aiming to identify high-impact organizations. It demonstrates the effective combination of traditional tools (Excel, PowerPoint) with AI to deliver data-driven insights.
